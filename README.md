Twitter engagement incentives: help airdrop tokens to people who RT/Like/Follow on Twitter. Most likely involves a Merkle drop (“claim” button) with a form to share one’s Ethereum address), automatically sent out to people.

I've tried it manually with TryRoll link, but would love more experimentation on how to best distribute tokens on social media, to the right people: https://twitter.com/AlexMasmej/status/1311839931522785281?s=20

There's also https://onlytweets.co/ and https://cctip.io but I feel like we could improve this model.
